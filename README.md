# Adaptive Dynamic Memory Allocation and Fragmentation Analysis Tool

## Description
This project is a C++ simulation of dynamic memory allocation in operating systems.
It demonstrates how memory is allocated and deallocated using different strategies.
The project also analyzes internal and external fragmentation and supports adaptive allocation.

## Features
- First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit allocation strategies
- Adaptive memory allocation
- Memory deallocation and merging of free blocks
- Fragmentation analysis (internal and external)
- Memory compaction to reduce external fragmentation
- Console-based memory visualization (optional)

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Code::Blocks
2. Compile and run `main.cpp`
3. Follow the console menu instructions
